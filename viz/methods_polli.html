<p>Wild pollination of crops is critical to ensure people a healthy nutritious diet to humans. Habitat quality is important for insect pollinators, such as bees, pollen wasps, ants, flies or butterflies to thrive.</p>

<h1 id="naturescontributionstopeoplencpframework">Nature's Contributions to People (NCP) Framework</h1>

<p>This framework for assessing Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP), is based on:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>humanity’s needs for benefits from nature</strong> (potential need based on biophysical pressures +  population exposed),</li>

<li><strong>nature’s contribution</strong> to meeting such needs. </li>
</ul>

<img src="images/methods/framework.png" alt="" />


<p>For pollination, the potential human need for benefits of nature is manifested by the total agricultural crop output that is dependent to some degree on insect pollination. We consider “local” beneficiaries as populations whose dietary requirements exceed pollinator-independent production within 100 km. The need met by nature is the yield or production attributable to pollination where it has been sufficiently delivered by pollinators from surrounding habitat, and nature’s contribution is represented by the proportion of total potential pollination-dependent crop output that is produced.</p>

<h1 id="scenarios">Scenarios</h1>

<p>We examine changes in these individual components of the NCP, from current (2015) conditions to future (2050) scenarios. To imagine cohesive futures, climate scientists have developped the the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) (Rosa, 2017). Widely used by the climate research community (IPCC, IPBES...), these narratives for future trajectories in land-use, climate and population change. We considered 3 scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The  <strong>Sustainability</strong> scenario, (SSP1 paired with RCP 2.6) depicts a "Greener" world shifting gradually toward a more sustainable path, emphasizing more inclusive development (reducing inequalities) and respect of the environment.</p></li>

<li><p>The <strong>Regional Rivalry</strong> scenario (SSP3 paired with RCP 6.0) forecast resurgent nationalism, where countries are concerned about competitiveness and security, there are conflicts. Economic development is slow, education and tech investments declines, inequalities worsen. Climate change is intense and there is strong environmental degradation in some regions.</p></li>

<li><p>The <strong>Fossil-Fueled Development</strong> (SSP5 paired with RCP 8.5) depicts a world where humanity takes the capitalist highway, with high faith in competitive markets, innovation and participatory societies. This world is more and more globalized, with big investments in health, education, and socio-economic development in general. However, this happens with vast exploitation of abundant fossil fuel resources and very consumerist lifestyles, geo-engineering is viewed as the solution.</p></li>

<h1 id="modelingcroppollinationandmicronutrientproduction">Modeling Crop Pollination and Micronutrient Production</h1>

<p>This section provides an overview of the method to estimate Nature’s Contribution to People in terms of pollination supporting crop micronutrient production, specifically pollinator-dependent Vitamin A, Folate and Energy (KJ). We first calculate wild pollination sufficiency provided by habitat around farmland, and the pollination dependence of crop-based production of different micronutrients. We then use these outputs along with data on local dietary requirements to determine humanity’s needs and nature’s contributions, as the dual components of NCP. </p>

<h3 id="wildpollinationsufficiencypollinatorhabitat">Wild Pollination Sufficiency (Pollinator Habitat)</h3>

<p>Pollination sufficiency is based on the area of pollinator habitat around farmland. Agricultural pixels with >30% natural habitat in the 2 km area surrounding the farm are designated as receiving sufficient pollination for pollinator-dependent yields. </p>

<h3 id="pollinationdependentnutrientproduction">Pollination-Dependent Nutrient Production</h3>

<p>Pollination-dependence of 115 crops (Klein, 2007), crop yields (Monfreda, 2008), and crop micronutrient content (USDA, 2011) were combined in an analysis to calculate pollination-dependent nutrient production (following Chaplin-Kramer, 2012) .</p>
